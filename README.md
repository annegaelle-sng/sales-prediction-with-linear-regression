This  project is based on fictional company data collected on Kaggle. Our goal? To shake a litlle bit the way companies estimate their turnover and make informed decisions about their advertising budget.

With the right allocation of resources towards different advertising channels, sales have the potential to skyrocket! And we're making it easier than ever before. At the end of this project, we're presenting a dynamic mini-simulator built with the interactive widgets of Jupiter Notebook. It's as simple as entering your budget allocations and letting the magic happen.

Say goodbye to guesswork and hello to accurate predictions powered by a rigorously selected linear regression model. :)
